		about: `Many products often fail to satisfy the ever dynamic requirements of customers, especially the hidden ones. The same applies to financial services products where regulations, technology, increasing customer sophistication combine with competition and other factors to drive customer expectations.
        Between requirements and the post-experience perception of the customers, a lot of things can, and often go wrong due to gaps in understanding, design, and implementation of the requirements. In some organizations, new product launches are followed by overwhelming customer complaints, firefighting and high costs of poor quality.
        This course is designed to familiarize participants with the tools and techniques for identifying express and hidden customer requirements or expectations and creating and delivering financial services which consistently meet or exceed them.`,

		about: `Problems like errors, fraud, customer complaints etc occur regularly in most organisations. In less efficient firms, repeat problems (audit comments, safety issues etc) are common. What differs is how each organisation responds to the challenge and learn from it. According to Jack Welch, "an organisations ability to learn and translate that learning into action rapidly is the ultimate competitive advantage".
        An effective Corrective / Preventive Action (CAPA) programme enables them to prevent or quickly solve most of the problems above. However, several organizations do not have a credible CAPA programme running or have yet to unlock up to 40% of possible benefits, due to uncomplimentary policies, processes and technology.
        The aim of this workshop is to equip participants with the knowledge, skills and tools to help organizations extract more value from their CAPA programs, apart from merely fulfilling certification requirements. This value can be very significant especially for large, complex organisations or those who are undergoing or have recently undergone major changes.`,

Performance Management helps the organization to break down corporate strategic goals and objectives into measurable sub-components. It also helps to coordinate and channel the activities of the organization towards building and applying the competences required to achieve the goals.
        Without a unifying framework, organizations perform sub- optimally as various component units of an organization tend (at varying degrees) to repeat what another unit is doing, or omit important activities entirely or sometimes even work at cross purposes. Also, certain practices can either motivate or demotivate employees from performing at their potential capacity.`,

A business process is the logical organization of people, materials, energy, equipment, and information into work activities designed to produce a required product or service
